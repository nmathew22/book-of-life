Today was busy but enjoyable. I started the day by lifting at Payne Whitney gym, then I showered and had lunch at Commons with my friend Neil. After that, I spent some time with my mom, catching up and talking about our plans for the week. Lastly, I spent the afternoon studying probability theory. It was an enjoyable day filled with activity and quality time with family and friends.</div>
